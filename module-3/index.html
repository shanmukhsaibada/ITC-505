        <p>Hello! I'm Shanmukha Sai Bada, a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. I am student who is currently pursuing masters in information students in nortehrn arizona university. I am passionate about creating dynamic websites and also i've done an intership on frontend development. An e-commerce website typically involves a combination of several languages for both the front-end (user-facing side) and back-end (server-side) functionalities. Here's a breakdown of the languages likely used: Front-End: HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the website. CSS: Controls the visual design and layout of the website, including styling elements like product images, buttons, and text. JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the website, such as handling user actions (adding items to cart), search functionality, and dynamic content updates. Back-End (depending on the platform):Server-Side Scripting Language (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby): Processes user requests, interacts with the database, and generates dynamic website content. SQL: Database query language for storing and retrieving product information, user data, and order details</p>

        <p>Hello This is shanmukha sai bada, im currently pursuing my masters in northern arizona university where my major is masters in information technologies and coming to my undergradution i've pursued my undergradution in computer science. I also Developed a project based on machine learning which was huge success during my udergradution where we achived an accuracy of 80 percent in just 4 months which is really huge. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the future career paths of students based on their academic performance and other relevant factors.Implemented various algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. Used data from academic records, extracurricular activities, and standardized test scores.Developed a web interface for users to input their data and get career predictions. Achieved an accuracy rate of 85% on test data.</p>
